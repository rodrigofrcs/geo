## Description

Compass is an Open Sourse project, aiming to provide a manager discussed and highly customizable content. The Compass is composed of a central system, called core and five other additional modules, namely CMS Compass, Compass Books, Journal Compass, Compass and Compass Eventus Helpdesck.

The core of the Compass is built on the foundations of EllisLab-CodeIgniter and appearance based on ZURB-Foundation.

Any developer can collaborate adding something new to the system and spreading to other users, users with little or no knowledge can also use the Compass in managing their applications.

## Installation

* Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything.
* Open http://yoursite.com/install in your browser. You will be taken to the configuration process of the config.php file with the connection details from your database.
  * If for some reason this does not work, do not worry. This does not work on all servers hosting. Open the ./ Compass-admin/config/database.php with a text editor like WordPad or similar and fill in your database connection.
  * Save the file as config.php and upload.
  * Open http://yoursite.com/install path on your browser.
* When the configuration file is ready, the installer will create the necessary tables for your system. If an error occurs, check again your database.php file, and try again. If it fails again , please visit the support forums with all the information you can gather.
* In the next step, some information is required for insertion into the database, the basic operating system data.
* The installation should then send you to the login page. Fill in the username and password chosen during installation.
